# Machine Learning Course: From Theory to Practice

## Course Overview
This comprehensive machine learning course bridges traditional wisdom with modern AI techniques, providing a three-dimensional learning approach: theoretical foundations, visual understanding, and practical implementation.

## Course Structure

### Learning Philosophy
Each module follows a three-way learning approach:
1. **Theory (What it is)** - Conceptual understanding with traditional analogies
2. **Visualization (How to see it)** - Interactive visual demonstrations
3. **Code (How to implement it)** - Hands-on programming exercises

## Module Overview

| Module | Topic | Status | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | ✅ Complete | ML fundamentals, supervised vs unsupervised |
| 2 | Linear Regression | 🔧 In Progress | OLS, gradient descent, MSE |
| 3 | Logistic Regression | 🔧 In Progress | Classification, sigmoid, cross-entropy |
| 4 | Decision Trees | 📝 Planned | Entropy, information gain, pruning |
| 5 | Random Forest | 📝 Planned | Bagging, ensemble methods |
| 6 | Gradient Boosting | 📝 Planned | Boosting, XGBoost, sequential learning |
| 7 | Support Vector Machines | 📝 Planned | Kernels, margin maximization |
| 8 | Neural Networks | 📝 Planned | Backpropagation, deep learning basics |
| 9 | Clustering | 📝 Planned | K-means, hierarchical clustering |
| 10 | Ensemble Learning | 📝 Planned | Voting, stacking, blending |
